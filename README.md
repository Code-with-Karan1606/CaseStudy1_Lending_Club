# Lending Club Case Study
> How data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Business Understanding

- consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
- receiving a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan,then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Loan Dataset
